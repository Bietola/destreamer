1. Go to the webpage containing all the links.
2. Use `Link Gopher` to extract them (let them all load first by scrolling down 'till the page end).
3. Put gopher links into `links/gopher-links`.
4. Run `filter-links-from-gopher.sh`
5. Video links should be in `links/video-links` file.
6. Run `cluster-dl.sh`
7. WIP: Handle errors
8. Enjoy
